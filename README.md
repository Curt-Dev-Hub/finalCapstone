# My Final Capstone Project

## Why I created this project

This project came from my love of football as a whole :cupid: and my passion for the architecture and individual personality and character each football stadium presents.

One of the great things about the web is that it brings people together from all corners of the world, and allows people to share their views and opinions.
It would be very interesting to me to see peoples thoughts and feedback on my stadium rankings list, and this is why I chose this as my final capstone project on my HyperionDev course :relaxed:

### **My next steps for this project**

I still need to add full functionality to the buttons I've added on the pictures in this project which will allow users to either like their favorite pictures,
or save them to a personal space on their device.
Also I would like to leave a space for users to add comments to the webpage. 

### Installation

You can follow these handy steps in order to install this project locally on your device:

- Navigate to download.
- Tap the Menu in your browser. In Chrome, Edge, and Brave, you’ll find it at the top-right corner.
- From the available options, select More Tools.
- Then, click on the Save page as.
- You’ll now see the option to save the webpage HTML file on your computer.
- Select your desired location and click on Save.


Alternatively, whilst on the project webpage, you can press Ctrl + S on your keyboard and hit the Save button. 
Doing this will save the complete webpage on your computer. You can open the HTML file in your browser anytime for offline reading.

**Doing this more regularly wherever possible can help reduce your carbon footprint! :deciduous_tree::deciduous_tree:**
